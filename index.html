        <h2>Home</h2>
        <p>The project centers around integrating these technologies into a smart
            helmet system designed to monitor and assess the force experienced by 
            football players during gameplay. The accelerometer, placed within the helmet, 
            captures real-time data on impacts and calculates the force exerted on the player's head. 
            The Raspberry Pi processes this information and utilizing a programmable communication tool for, 
            sending, and receiving text messages. The communication platform sends an immediate text message alert to 
            the coach if a threshold force indicative of a potential concussion is exceeded. This comprehensive system not only 
            promotes player safety by providing instant notifications to coaching staff but also serves as a 
            valuable tool for long-term monitoring and analysis to enhance concussion prevention strategies and
            hopefully reduce the number of players who get CTE in sports.</p>
