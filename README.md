Abstract:

The project centers around integrating these technologies into a smart helmet system designed to monitor and assess the force experienced by football players during gameplay. The accelerometer, placed within the helmet, captures real-time data on impacts and calculates the force exerted on the player's head. The Raspberry Pi processes this information and utilizing a programmable communication tool for, sending, and receiving text messages. The communication platform sends an immediate text message alert to the coach if a threshold force indicative of a potential concussion is exceeded. This comprehensive system not only promotes player safety by providing instant notifications to coaching staff but also serves as a valuable tool for long-term monitoring and analysis to enhance concussion prevention strategies and hopefully reduce the number of players who get CTE in sports.
